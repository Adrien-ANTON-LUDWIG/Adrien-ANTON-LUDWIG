## About me

üéì I am a student in computer science engineering at EPITA in Paris, France. Currently in my final year of master, I am completing my specialization in image processing. Through the last year, I learned about computer vision, signal processing, machine learning, deep learning, data treatment and visualisation, GPU programming, distributed programming and a few other image related skills.
